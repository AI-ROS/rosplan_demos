# ROSPlan Demos

Tutorials and Demos for ROSPlan.

### Running a demo with the turtlebot

The turtlebot demo is now a simple exploration mission. The turtlebot will visit randomly generated waypoints around a map.

The domain for this demo is in the `rosplan_demos` package, as `common/domain_turtlebot_demo.pddl`.

To run the demo first follow the installation instructions and quick-start guide for the Turtlebot Simulator and Gazebo:

[Turtlebot Gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo) 

[Turtlebot Simulator](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator) 

Then source the ROSPlan workspace in two terminals.

*1.* In the first terminal, begin the simulation, rviz visualisation, and ROSPlan nodes using the `turtlebot.launch` from the rosplan_demos package:
```
roslaunch rosplan_demos turtlebot.launch
```

*2.* In the second terminal run `turtlebot_explore.bash`, a script which
- adds to the knowledge base the PDDL objects and facts which comprise the initial state;
- adds the goals to the knowledge base; and
- calls the ROSPlan services which generate a plan and dispatch it.
```
rosrun rosplan_demos turtlebot_explore.bash
```

You should see the following output from the script:
```
waypoints: ['wp0', 'wp1', 'wp2', 'wp3', 'wp4', 'wp5']
Adding initial state and goals to knowledge base.
success: True
success: True
Calling problem generator.
Calling planner interface.
Calling plan parser.
Calling plan dispatcher.
Finished!
```

The turtlebot will move around the waypoints, exploring the environment. You should see output in the first terminal, something like:
```
...
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) Generating problem file.
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) The problem was generated.
KCL: (/rosplan_planner_interface) Problem received.
